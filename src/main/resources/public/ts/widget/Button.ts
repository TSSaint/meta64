/*
IMPORTANT: Eventually ALL GUI elements in the entire meta64 app will be some kind of Comp-derived Widget like this Button class.
But at the time I'm adding this comment only but Button Widget is the only working prototype of this new architecture. The main
design innovation here is that JSX is just as awkward as any other 'Templating Approach' to GUI construction and the codebase
of meta64 will be able to undeniably demonstrate that fact.
