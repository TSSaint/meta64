### Key Concepts of the App

* When you signup you get an account SubNode that holds everything you ever create.

* A SubNode is just like a File or Folder (think of a 'File System')

* Every post, reply, or piece of content is a SubNode.

* SubNodes behave like Folders because they can contain other SubNodes.

* SubNodes behave like Files because they are editable and hold your actual content

* In most 'Social Media' Apps you create a post, or a tweet, or whatever. In SubNode, you "Crate SubNodes"

* To 'reply' to someone's post, you create a SubNode underneath the one you're replying to.


### Quick Tips for Getting Started

* At any time you will be viewing one SubNode (shown at the top of the page), and all the SubNodes it contains defines the content of your page.

* If a node contains other SubNodes, it will show a Green "Open" button, to drill down into the content.

* Once you drill down into content and want to climb back out, use the Triangle Icon (up function) at the upper right of the page, which will take you up one level to the parent SubNode of the one you are currently viewing.

* You have to first click on a node to select it before you can, insert under it or edit it. There will be a RED bar indicator on the left of the selected node.

* Use the "Pencil Icon" at the upper right, to put the app in "Edit Mode", or else you won't be able to modify any content.

* To create new content use the menu on the left: "Edit -> Create -> First"

* To edit a node click the "Pencil Icon" above it.
