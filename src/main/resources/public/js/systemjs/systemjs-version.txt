This version of system.js came from:

Known to be compatible with TypeScript: 1.8.10

systemjs-0.20.0-rc.4.zip

Warning: Whenever you update either TypeScript or SystemJS versions, go ahead and upgrade the other one as well
because these two can easily become incompatible versions of they are not compatible versions, and the only
way to best ensure compatibility is get both updated at same time.
