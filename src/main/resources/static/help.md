#Meta64 User Guide

* All the following information assumes you are a logged in registered user. If not logged in most of these things will be disabled or completly hidden.

* You can click individual rows to "select them" for menu operations, and the Red Bar on the left
  means that row is "selected".

* Many of the menu items on the left operate on the "currently selected node(s)" that you select in the main view.


##How To...

###Create a New Node (i.e. add Content)

* Click "MY INFO" to go to the root of your content.

* Click "EDIT MODE" to make the page display the editing controls.

* Click "Add" button on a row to insert a new node underneath the selected one, or click the "Ins" button to insert a new node directly inline with the other children at that page level.


###Edit an Existing Node

* If you didn't click "EDIT MODE" button, so so first.

* Click "Edit" button on the row you want to edit. 

* Node Editor dialog opens up. Enter you content and/or other properties, and then click "Save" button.


###Upload Images (or any kind of Attachment) onto a Node

* Select the node you want to upload onto.

* Click "Attachments -> Upload from File" (or URL) 

* Enter the filename info in the Dialog which follows, and click "Upload" button

You can upload any kind of attachment to any node, but if your attachment happens to be an image then it's automatically rendered in place when you view the tree. Other types of attachments just offer a link to the content.
