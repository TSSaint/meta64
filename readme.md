## SubNode: Open-Source CMS/Portal

SubNode is an Open Source "Mobile First" Wiki-type content repository (or CMS) built on Apache Oak JCR and MongoDb back-end (on Java SpringBoot), with Google Polymer-based and TypeScript coded front-end. The sbnode.com website itself is running an instance of the SubNode portal software. 

This technology itself is a platform for building portals. This "Portal Platform" allows users to signup and create accounts where they can host content. The content can be any kind of text, data, images, and/or binaries, and can be shared to other users, who can then browse and/or edit the content collaboratively. The goal is to create a portal that is somewhat similar to Wikipedia (collaborative editing and sharing), but having many Social Media-types of capabilities. Another goal, from a technology standpoint, was to use only content repository open-standards for data, open source APIs, highly scalable data storage, and a very modern Mobile front end.

## News & Latest Developments

The next step in evolution of SubNode is the addition of **blockchain technology**. The goal will be to have a secure public-key encrypted, publicly open (like BitCoin is), decentralized P2P, democratic concensus-based, social media solution that will commoditize this server technology and put control back in the hands of the people. 

Currently the social media space is completely monopolized and controlled by Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc. These monopolies take your data, sell it, claim to own it, push ADs, and try to manipulate and control society. People who are already well versed in blockchain know that the world is abuzz right now about the fact that blockchain technologies are poised to destroy these monopolies. SubNode will hopefully help move in this direction, and show at least one complete end-to-end vision of how a new blockchain-based web would be architected on top of Content Repository databases. 

SubNode is actually a bit more generalized than just a "Social Media" technology, because it's just plainly a shared content tree, just like blockchains are simply a shared 'linked-list'. In order for a blockchain to become widely usable as a general purpose data structure it has to be really a form of (a Merkle) tree, which is why the JCR is the one and only obvious core technology for it. Also for a generalized blockchain to become popular (as opposed to a cryptocurrency) and usable it needs to have a GUI layer to go with it, offering full-text search, data entry, organization, timelines, etc; so that it's more than just code miners can run. All of this is what SubNode has always been even before a blockchain addition to it was ever envisioned.

What will make up the core of the SubNode blockchain, at the data layer, will be a Merkle Tree (same algorithm at the core of all blockchains) layer on top of the JCR layer, so that every piece of information created by any user will go onto the chain (as a tree node, or "SubNode") and be public, authenticatable back to each user, and uncorruptable (because of hashes). The immediate plan is just to have a system where each instance holds a full copy of the database (like a Blockchain miner), and participates in the distributed system.

## SubNode Overview

SubNode is at it's core a **Content Repository Browser**, or an app for interacting with hierarchical data. The technology however is much more than a Content Browser, because it presents a GUI front end appropriate to both non-technical users, as well as the more technical users of back-end content repositories. The theory here is that *"everything is content"* and since both end users and technical users need to be able to interact with hierarchical data stores, it's desirable to have one system architecture that serves both roles well. With the power of Lucene search and MongoDB storage on the backend, plus the fully standards-based open stack, the app is already able to provide incredible power only found in other commercial content repositories that are proprietary products, which are also mostly built on much older technology stacks.

For a social media user, SubNode can function as a blogging platform, file-sharing platform, social commenting platform, wiki system, personal website host, etc., while simultaneously functioning as a full-blown back-end JCR repository used by technical users like software developers, data architects, DB admins, etc. The way this is accomplished is by having a simplified set of features (i.e. rendering of the GUI) presented to non-technical users, while having the full featured JCR enterprise-capabilities offered by Apache Jackrabbit Oak.

There are just a few key concepts to know for a basic understanding of what JCR is all about, if you aren't familiar with the term:

### Key Concepts

* Everything is content: Text, images, file attachments, etc. are individual content nodes.
* JCR is a Content Repository (database) standard for Java.
* Data exists as a tree structure consisting of editable nodes.
* Each user owns a part of the tree and all subnodes under that make up their "account root".
* Node text and attachments can be edited (like on a Wiki)
* Markdown is used to do formatting of the nodes when displayed.
* Each node can be shared by its owner to the public or to specific users.
* Nodes can be created, edited, moved, and deleted just like in a file system.
* Any type of binary content can be uploaded onto nodes, and attached images show up as part of the page.
* Each node can be referenced by direct-linking to it on the URL, so users can publish their own pages with specific urls.
* Essentially SubNode itself is a kind of tree-structured wiki, or just a tree of editable, sharable content, just like you see on social media, but completely general purpose.
* The sbnode.com site itself also has a high-level summary of the core features.

## Apache Jackrabbit Oak

Other than SpringBoot, the main dependency (i.e. Maven) needed for running/building SubNode is Jackrabbit Oak. This project is currently being hosted here:

https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak   
https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/index.html

Jackrabbit Oak is an Adobe-sponsored Open Source project for creating the best world-class JCR implementation. It is extremely high performance and hugely scalable largely due to Lucene as the search technology in use, and also because of MongoDB. As with any "NoSQL" the primary concern is indeed performance and scalability, instead of transactional concerns, so the ACID transactions of an RDBMS are sacrificed for the "eventually consistent" model offered by a NoSQL approach.

## About the Developer

SubNode is a FOSS (Free Open Source Software) project created by Clay Ferguson. I'm a Java Developer living in Dallas, Texas. I have 26 years of coding experience consisting of 10 years of C++ followed by 16 years of Java, all on Web Apps, and mostly on analytical systems, accounting systems, point-of-sale systems, financial institution modeling, etc. However, Content Repositories have always been my passion throughout my career, and I've had some 'version' of SubNode in existence since 1998, under various different names and technology stacks. As a result, this app has been totally rewritten about 5 times over the decades. It went from C++, to Java Swing, to plain HTML+Servlets, to Struts, then to GWT, and finally to TypeScript+Polymer+Spring. Each time I restarted, technology had progressed dramatically; but more importantly, my ideas about the design and feature-set improved. Hopefully other users and developers will find this technology (in SubNode) to be of value as well.
