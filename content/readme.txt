NOTE: About the files contained in this folder and direct subfolders.

The file named 'help-main-menu.xml' should be imported to "http://sbnode.com?id=/meta64/public/help", in order to make application help menu work. 
The help menu works by simply pointing the user to this location and letting them view the help documentation as online nodes, just like any other content in the system.

The file named meta64.public.home.xml is published at "http://sbnode.com?id=/meta64/public/home", and contains ALL information available to everyone related to SubNode,
including any white-paper type material, technical documentation, etc.

NOTE: Don't forget to make this node 'public' in the sharing dialog so that everyone can see it.
