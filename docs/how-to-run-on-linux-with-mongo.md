## Default MongoDB Config File
    /etc/mongod.conf 
    
In that config file everything is configured including the db location which defaults to this:
    
    dbpath=/var/lib/mongodb

## Running the Meta64 Server on Linux

* Note that the spring.config.location argument (as in the command below) you are required to include the main application.properties file as well as one of the profile ones (ending in -test, -dev, or -production)

    Sell script content for Linux:
    
    # nohup java -jar com.meta64.mobile-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --jcrAdminPassword=yourPasswordHere --spring.config.location=classpath:/application.properties,classpath:/application-test.properties &

## Get your Process ID

Run this command, to find your java Process ID

    # jps -ml

## Killing the Process by ID

To stop a process by PID (NNNN=PID you got from jps command):
	
    # kill NNNN	

## Or Even better (Kill the process on one step)

    # pkill -f com.meta64.mobile
    
Looks up the process(es) that contain 'com.meta64.mobile' and kills them. This should safely target and kill the meta64 app. See also 'pgrep' which lists them without killing.


# Running the Meta64 Server (Proper way for Production)

Linux service init script are stored into /etc/init.d. You can copy and customize /etc/init.d/skeleton file, and then call

    # sudo service mongod start
    # sudo service mongod stop

# To start MongoDb if not setup as a Service
    mongod --dbpath /usr/local/mongodb-data --port 27017

# Backing up a Live Running MongoDb Instance

Assumes you want your backup saved in folder "/backup", and the rest is self-explanatory

    # cd /backup

	 # Note: Username and password can be omitted if the db is not secured with credentials.
    # mongodump --db mongodevdb --username mongodevdb --password YourSecretPwd
    
# Securing MongoDB 

As of MongoDB version 2.6.0, the deb and rpm packages (installers) include a default configuration file (/etc/mongod.conf) that sets net.bindIp to 127.0.0.1. Which will suffice for disallowing external machines from connecting.

    bind_ip = 127.0.0.1
