#List of Known Bugs

* When on mobile android, and it's rendering with no buttons above each row (like when edit mode is off) it leaves a full amount of the space for those buttons, so we need to be sure not to generate the button HTML for rows in this situation

* when logged in anonymously it's possible to uplevel your way up out of the content where you can't get back.
