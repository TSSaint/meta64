#List of Known Bugs

* For anonymous users (not logged in) the props and edit buttons on the top controlbar should not be there.

* When user clicks a URL link on a page that points back to somewhere on meta64, like the link in the main page to the War and Peace book, sometimes you have to refresh the page or else it won't load.

* when logged in anonymously it's possile to uplevel your way up out of the content where you can't get back.

* when user clicks a link that points back onto meta64 url, it reloads browser and the session that is in place should be having the effect of logging in the user if they were currently logged in but is not correctly indicating that it's doing that, even though I think the session beans scoping is fine.
